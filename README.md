Traffic congestion on road network is characterized by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queuing. In India, vehicle volume is increased exponentially, but the road infrastructure cannot be, that leads to increase traffic congestion. Different technologies are there to detect traffic congestion and making congestion management more efficient. But these technologies have several drawbacks, such as installation problems, complexity, cost, etc. So, we are introducing CAR SYSTEM ACCESSORIES for TRANSPORTATION SMOOTHING. An ARM7 based system accompanied by RF Transceivers, and Wireless Networking Technology for vehicle with the following objectives: - Accident detection & alerting - A high vehicle density in a particular lane causes a traffic signal in that particular direction to remain open for larger duration thus adaptively controlling the signal - Tollgate management by identifying vehicles instantly within Toll Area - Warning message to driver about zones where careful driving is necessary such as accident prone zone, zigzag roads, school, hospital, etc.
